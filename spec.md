# Project Specification: Otterly Fun Swim School Webpage

## What I Want to Build
I want to create a user-friendly web interface for parents who wish to enroll their children in my swimming school. The website will serve as an information hub and booking platform for all swim courses offered.

## Why I Want to Build It
- To make it easy for parents to find all necessary information about the swim school, courses, prices, and schedules in one place.
- To streamline the booking process, making it more efficient for both parents and the swim school.
- To provide clear communication and guidance to parents, helping them prepare their children for swim classes.
- To reduce administrative workload by automating bookings and information delivery.

## For Whom
- Primary audience: Parents of children interested in learning to swim or improving their swimming skills.
- Secondary audience: Prospective students (children) and anyone seeking information about the swim school.

**Future Features:**

Looking ahead, several enhancements are planned to further improve the experience for both parents and trainers, and to streamline course administration:

### AI-Powered WhatsApp Bot
  - Integrate an AI-driven bot on WhatsApp to assist parents with common questions about courses, payment, and booking.

### Mobile App for Parents
  - Develop a mobile application to help parents manage their bookings and payments.

### Trainer Login and Session Logs
  - Allow trainers to log in via the website to access administrative features.

These future features aim to make the platform more user-friendly and responsive to the needs of both parents and trainers.

3. Parent books a spot in a course if available.
